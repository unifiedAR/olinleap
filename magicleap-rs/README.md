# Magic Leap apps, but with rust

This project provides bindings to MagicLeap's C API to allow interfacing with Rust code. This means we can build entire applications for the MagicLeap using the Rust ecosystem and tooling for fast and safe application libraries. We can also tap into the growing ecosystem of packages for working with image processing, machine learning, physics, and webservers.
